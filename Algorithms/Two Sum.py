# for this problem, give a list of integers from input, you have to return the 2 indices that 
# add up to the sum of the target number (also from input)
# for example: if you are give a list that is [2,7,11,15] and the target = 9
#    then you would return [0,1] because 2+7 = 9

class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
